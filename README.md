# Farey Tree Visualization using ManimGL

This project visualizes the **Farey Tree** (also known as the **Stern–Brocot Tree**) using **ManimGL**.  
Each rational number in the tree corresponds to a unique sequence of left (L) and right (R) turns from the root (1/1).  
The Python function `Eucl(n, d)` computes this sequence using the Euclidean algorithm, and ManimGL is used to animate the path.

## Mathematical Idea

The Farey Tree is generated by the **mediant rule**:

\[
\frac{a}{b} \text{ and } \frac{c}{d} \Rightarrow \frac{a+c}{b+d}
\]

Starting from `0/1` and `1/0`, this process generates all positive fractions exactly once in their simplest form.  
The path to each fraction can also be determined using the **Euclidean algorithm**, where:
- **L (-1)** = move to the left child (smaller fraction)
- **R (1)** = move to the right child (larger fraction)

---


**Example:**
```python
Eucl(3, 5)
# Output: [1, 1, -1] → Path: R, R, L
```
This means move right twice, then left, to reach the fraction 3/5 in the Farey Tree.
